        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hii, Im Tushar Soni, a Youtuber, Full stack Web Developer, Freelancer and most importantly a Gamer in Free TimeüòÅ.</p>
        <p>I love to try and learn new things from my best teacher, INTERNET. Yep your read it right! Everything nowadays can be learned from internet for free of cost (if you have a internet connection of course which also comes after paying money, so not exactly free but yeahüëΩ).</p>
        <p>So first back in 2020 I initially took admission in a college, and decided to drop-out after a month, to do study on my own, to do something really big and to chase my dreams in my own way, this was a risk I know, but it started to work slowly and im learning new and latest technologies from internet, not the 60 years old stuff from college(pun intended). I'm not saying college is bad or like that. This is way i took and these are my personal openion.</p>
        <p>Today I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a 50k+ Subscribers YouTube channel and alot of freelance projects.</p>
